Here's an attempted constructive proof that P = NP and the Integer Factorization Problem is NP-Complete.

I made use of Satlib: Holger H. Hoos and Thomas St√ºtzle: SATLIB: An Online Resource for Research on SAT. In: I.P.Gent, H.v.Maaren, T.Walsh, editors, SAT 2000, pp.283-292, IOS Press, 2000. SATLIB is available online at www.satlib.org.

I discovered through this exercise that there could be sequences of arbitrary length (eg, 100 bits) where the best you can do is the lowest bit of those arbitrary-numbered bits.

Today I finally considered that P != NP. 6-14-2025.

I am temporarily suspending work on this project until a clear insight occurs to me.

If this algorithm is the best you can do for 3SAT, then P != NP.
