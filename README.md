# getfactors

I worked since the fall of 2002 to find a constructive proof that P = NP. I achieved my goal.

Included is the 3SAT solver and a framework that performs the factorization of arbitrary-size integers, among other math and logic operations.

It is buggy but it clearly and constructively shows, in source code form, that P = NP and integer factorization is np-complete.

I'm currently debugging this and setting up multithreading, as it is embarassingly parallelizable.

I submitted this intellectual property to the public domain as a gift to all of humanity. I published the work at https://www.amazon.com/NP-3SAT-Coverage-False-Clauses-ebook/dp/B08P93KY4B?ref_=ast_author_mpb in November of 2020.
