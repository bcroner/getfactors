# getfactors

I worked since the fall of 2002 to find a constructive proof that P = NP. I achieved my goal.

Included is the 3SAT solver and a framework that performs the factorization of arbitrary-size integers, among other math and logic operations.

It is buggy but it clearly and constructively shows, in source code form, that P = NP and integer factorization is np-complete.

I'm currently debugging this and setting up multithreading, as it is embarassingly parallelizable.

I published some of the work at https://www.amazon.com/NP-3SAT-Coverage-False-Clauses-ebook/dp/B08P93KY4B?ref_=ast_author_mpb in November of 2020.

This source code has some sort of a performance bug in it that hinders its ability to crack larger problems. I'm calling on
all tech studs to take a fresh look at this, fork it, and fix what's wrong. I'm just so burned out and sick of working on it. I thought that by
releasing this now, it's both an act of self-love and a benevolent act of love for everyone in the world. I realize that I'm leaving money on the
table, but after spending over 20 years of my life on this, I can't continue, despite my best efforts. I'm fighting my own physiology here.
So I'm passing the baton. Shout out to satlib for the coding and debugging material I used. What's happening is my psychopathic subconscious
subpersonality superpower, whom I call "Roy," refuses to even inspect the source code anymore. So I'll reluctantly pass the baton. To you.
