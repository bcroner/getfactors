# getfactors

I worked since the fall of 2002 to find a constructive proof that P = NP. Here is a partial result.

Included is the 3SAT solver and a framework that performs the factorization of arbitrary-size integers, among other math and logic operations.

It is buggy, and by that I mean it has a performance bug, but it shows where I concluded my research.

I published some of the work at https://www.amazon.com/NP-3SAT-Coverage-False-Clauses-ebook/dp/B08P93KY4B?ref_=ast_author_mpb in November of 2020. I unpublished this e-book on 7/29/2024.

I'm fully burned out on this. I'm sick of working on it and I can't go on with it. So, here's 22 years.
