On 12-13-2025 at 6:22 pm Pacific Time I became convinced that P != NP. After over 23 years I'm immediately suspending work on this project.

1. Effective jumps via base literal access are required because there could be an arbitrary difference between the highest order among the limit literals and n (eg, 100 or 1000), resulting in an exponential number of effective jumps offered by limit literals.

2. Effective jumps via base literal access are not possible. Suppose you have 4 successive jumps resulting in two limit literals that are inverses of each other. You may now replace the final jump with the 2nd-lowest-ordered limit literal, leaving one more literal to clear before base access can be achieved. In order to do this, you must have another 2 jumps, which creates 2 additional limit literals that must be cleared. To do this, you must create an addition 4 successive jumps, resulting in 4 more limit literals that must be cleared to achieve base literal access. This sequence repeats indefinitely.

3. Advances through the search space of magnitude 2<sup>y</sup> where y is an arbitrary number is the best you can do as n grows large. Assume not. Assume there is a heuristic-based algorithm like DPLL or one of its variants. Because no heuristic applies to all logic instances, when the heuristic fails, in the worst case all possibilities must be exhaustively tried. In this case, we advance through the search space with jumps of magnitude 2<sup>0</sup>, which is worse than jumps of magnitude 2<sup>y</sup> where y is an arbitrary number. What about a constant number c of advances through the search space? Not polynomial. Assume there is some technique to develop the logic to advance through the entire search space of n variables by a constant number of times, c. Now increase n by 1: n+1. In the worst case, the complexity of the logic doubles, so the technique to advance through the search space c times doubles in logical complexity, which is exponential. What about advances through the search space by 2<sup>x</sup> where x = f(n), where f(n) != n - c' (which would also necessarily employ a technique that doubles in logical complexity when n is increased by 1)? As n grows large, these all become exponential.

4. This shows that 3SAT is not polynomial in the worst case, proving P != NP.
