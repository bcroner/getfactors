# getfactors

I worked for 21 years to find a constructive proof that P = NP. I achieved my goal.

Included is the 3SAT solver and a framework that performs the factorization of arbitrary-size integers, among other math and logic operations.

It is buggy and has compiler errors, but it clearly and constructively shows, in source code form, that P = NP and integer factorization is np-complete.
